I’ve hunted near, I’ve hunted far
<br/>
I even looked inside my car.
<br/>
I’ve lost my glasses, I’m in need,
<br/>
To have them now so I can read.
<br/>
I loudly swear and I curse
<br/>
Did I leave them in my purse?
<br/>
Are they behind the sofa, under the bed?
<br/>
Oh there they are—on my head!
